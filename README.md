# Covid19-Decathlon-Mask-Adapter
 3D adapter for decathlon masks in collaboration with the Clinico San Carlos Hospital of Madrid

 Adapter for the decathlon masks to be used as CPAP as a last resource during the Covid19 pandemic.

 Based on the https://isinnova.it/archivio-progetti/easy-covid-19/ project.

 After some time spent in my local hospital studying the viability of the isinovva project parts, we decided to remake the adaptor.
 Some safety factors as well as some medical factors were not taken into account in the original project.

 The adaptor can be printed without the need of supports.
